# Overview {-}

This guide is the **free core** for microbiome data visualization. It is designed to help you generate common plots and read them correctly.

It builds on outputs from **iMAP PART 08 (Exploratory Analysis)** and connects visualization choices to the questions they answer.

## Who this is for {-}

- Researchers working with 16S microbiome data outputs from QIIME2, mothur, or similar pipelines  
- Learners who can run code but want a clearer interpretation path for plots  
- Anyone preparing figures for manuscripts or reports  

## What you will learn {-}

- How to choose plots that match a biological or analytical question  
- How to read composition and ordination plots without over-claiming  
- How prevalence and filtering change what you see  
- How to structure a reproducible visualization workflow in R
